Databse Name: stock_market_database

Group Members: Dhruvang Jayswal, Dhyey Patel, Meet Shah

Project Description:
  We are interested in designing a database system to find the best stock in S&P 500.
  A collection of 500 stocks in the S&P500 to choose the best stock in the industry, 
  for each stock has its own unique Tickle symbol, price, and 52 week’s highs and lows 
  to store these data we need MySQL server to import data into the database server. 

  Once we find the stock using the database, we need to check the bunch of if-else 
  statements like check the dividend history, past year-to-date data, ROI, EPS, 
  and other stuff. Once met all conditions then buy and sell stocks according to 
  the time frame and make a certain percentage of profits. To check the all conditions, 
  we need one back-end software like an eclipse.

  The Originally of this database is to find the industry’s best stocks in S&P500. 
  In day-to-day life, traders are spending a reasonable amount of time and do analysis 
  to find the stocks but using this application (Project) they need to run some queries 
  and check the conditions in Eclipse to find the best stock.
